## Vote Maximizer 

[Vote Maximizer](https://votemaximizer.org/)

Developed the Vote Maximizer tool while working at the Electoral Innovation Lab. The application represents the relative strength of the vote for a voter in any given location in the United States, taking into account features such as the number of elections they can vote in, the closeness of those elections, and their impact on other people. I was responsible for processing this data and delivering it to the front-end interactive components, as well as assisting in the front-end development and managing deployment of the application overall through Heroku.

Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## CommonThread

[CommonThread](https://commonthread.works/)

An open-source tool for organizations to collect, organize, analyze, and share stories. This application is designed to bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative data for organizations in a very easy to use format that requires little technical expertise to operate. The application functions off of Django with PostgreSQL, and a front-end built using Sveltekit.

Languages: Python, PostgreSQL, Javascript (Svelte)

## Quiet Conflicts Data Visualizations

[Infographic](https://github.com/PJSuoc/quiet-conflicts/blob/main/static_final/static_final.pdf) and [Interactive Site](https://pjsuoc.github.io/conflict-migration/)

Data Visualizations done during the Data Visualization CAPP course focusing on the conflicts that are rarely in the news cycle across the globe- how intense they are, what kinds of conflicts they are, and how organized violence may be impacting the migration of people across the globe. Built with events data from the ACLED Violent Events Database and World Bank population data.

Languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Creator Mapper

A project focused on estimating the incomes of people whose primary job is creating content on the internet: video makers, streamers, podcasters, and countless other flavors of internet content included. With access to accurate data on income, these creators will be better able to negotiate with corporations and advertisors on payment, and true scope of income from content creation can begin to be seen for use in policy creation and in figuring out whether you might be willing to venture into those opportunities yourself.

The majority of code being utilized for this project is private. Reach out individually if you are interested in contributing.

Languages: Python
